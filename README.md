# Sentiment Analysis using NLP

Sentiment Analysis using NLP is a project that aims to extract valuable insights from textual data by determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a given piece of text. This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze sentiments and is implemented as part of the GitHub repository [project-repository](https://github.com/divyanv/SentimentAnalysis.git).

## Description

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, involves analyzing text to identify and classify the sentiment conveyed. It helps in understanding the overall sentiment of textual data, enabling us to extract meaningful insights. The project follows the following steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Gather and preprocess the textual data, cleaning and transforming it into a suitable format for analysis.
2. **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words or tokens to facilitate further processing.
3. **Stopword Removal**: Remove commonly used words that do not contribute significantly to sentiment analysis.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Represent the text in a format understandable by machine learning algorithms, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
5. **Sentiment Classification**: Employ machine learning or deep learning algorithms to classify the sentiment, ranging from traditional approaches like Naive Bayes and SVM to advanced methods like RNNs and Transformers.
6. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the sentiment analysis model using labeled data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
7. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model to analyze sentiments in new, unseen text data.

## Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/divyanv/SentimentAnalysis.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To utilize the sentiment analysis model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your text data or provide input for analysis.
2. Run the sentiment analysis script: `python sentiment_analysis.py`
3. Receive the sentiment classification results (positive, negative, or neutral) for each text input.
